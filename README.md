# P2P-SmartParking
P2P Smart Parking with Discovery server

Implemented intelligent parking using peer-to-peer architecture with Discovery server.
The idea is to consider the nodes as if they were the cars that exchange information in and out with the aim of always knowing how many spaces are available 
in the parking lot.
